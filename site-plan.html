      <h3>Language and Culture</h3>
      <h2>The dying Tahitian language</h2>
      <p>French Polynesia has been around for a long time. However, it has become french territory only somewhat recently.
        Because of this, the tahitian language is becoming less and less practiced, mostly spoken only by the older folks on the islands.
        Here is some good survival vocabulary in Tahitian that can bring you closer with the culture and tahtian locals!</p>
        <h2>The Tahitian "R"</h2>
        <p>Much of the tahitian alphabet is not how it is in english. The "Bs" are "p" sounds, many letters make "T" sounds, and the "R" is much different as well!
          To make an "R" sound in tahitian, you almost make a "D" sound with your tongue going forward across the roof of your mouth while you say it.
          If you have trouble with it, you could even just make a "D" sound instead!
        </p>
        <h2>Glottal Stops</h2>
        <p>In written Tahitian, apostraphes or glottal stops are used to halt sounds to better pronounce and differentiate other words.
          For example, "moa" means "chicken" while "mo'a" means "holy" or "sacred". To do this, just stop the sound before continuing the word or phrase!</p>
        </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Iaorana: "Hello","Good Morning", or "Good Evening", this word translates directly to "May you live!"
          This is the most commonly used greeting across French Polynesia. 
        </li>
        <li>Eaha to'oe huru?: "How are you?" You can respond to this with "Maita'i" (well) or "Maita'i roa (very well).
          If you are speaking to two people, you say "Eaha to orua huru?" And if it's more than two people, "Eaha to outou huru?"
        </li>
        <li>Mauru'uru: "Thank you!"</li>
        <li>Na Na: "Goodbye!"</li>
        <li>Fa'aitoito: A commonly used phrase meaning "Good luck" or "diligence"!</li>
      </ul>
